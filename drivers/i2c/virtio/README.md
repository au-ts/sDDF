# QEMU Version

Please ensure that you have the latest version of QEMU installed. This driver
is tested using version 9.0. Please note that the default QEMU version on
Ubuntu distributions is version 6.2. This will not work with our vhost-user
front-end and back-end.

# I2C Backend Daemon

We use the following I2C backend daemon:
https://github.com/rust-vmm/vhost-device/tree/main/vhost-device-i2c.

Please clone this repository and build the vhost-device-i2c daemon.
Follow the instructions in the README.md of this repository.

If you wish to run this daemon without sudo access, ensure that you
add your current user to the group associated with your desired
i2c device.
